# Flappy Bird Built in Python

## Introduction
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through gaps between pipes. This project is implemented in Python using the `pygame` library.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with `pygame`:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

## Functions
A basic implementation involves:
- Rendering the bird, background, and pipes
- Handling gravity and jumping mechanics
- Detecting collisions
- Keeping track of the score

However, It can be enhanced by adding a background music, a rotating function on the bird, addings difficulty levels etc.
